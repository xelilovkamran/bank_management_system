Task: Bank Account Management System

Objective:
Design and implement a bank account management system using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system should allow users to create, manage, and perform transactions on bank accounts.

Task Description:

1. Bank Account Class:

   - Create a class named `BankAccount` to represent individual bank accounts.
   - Each bank account should have attributes such as account number, account holder name, account type (e.g., savings, checking), and balance.
   - Implement methods within the `BankAccount` class for:
     - Initializing a new account with initial balance (`__init__()` method)
     - Depositing funds into the account (`deposit()` method)
     - Withdrawing funds from the account (`withdraw()` method)
     - Checking the account balance (`get_balance()` method)

2. Transaction History:

   - Maintain a transaction history for each bank account, recording details of all transactions such as deposit amount, withdrawal amount, and transaction date/time.
   - Implement a method to display the transaction history for a specific account (`display_transaction_history()` method).

3. Error Handling:

   - Implement appropriate error-handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as insufficient funds for withdrawals and invalid input parameters.

4. User Interface:

   - Develop a simple user interface (CLI) to interact with the bank account management system.
   - Users should be able to create new accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, check account balances, and view transaction history.

5. Additional Features:
   - Implement support for transferring funds between accounts.
   - Allow users to close their accounts.
   - Add support for different types of accounts with specific functionalities (e.g., savings account with interest calculation).

Submission Guidelines:

- Implement the bank account management system using Python and adhere to Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- Include a README file with instructions on how to run the application and interact with the system.
- Submit the Python script containing the implementation of the bank account management system, along with any additional documentation or comments as necessary.

Note: You are encouraged to explore and extend the functionality of the bank account management system beyond the provided requirements to enhance your learning experience.
